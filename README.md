# Ventilator_Associated_Event #
This is UMich SI 542 Course Project.

is a lightweight, open-source tool designed to 
systematically assess 
and quantify a patient’s risk of 
developing ventilator-associated 
complications (VAE / VAP) based on clinical parameters 
and ventilator care practices. 
By prompting for key inputs — 
such as intubation route, 
ventilation duration, 
subglottic secretion drainage, 
head-of-bed elevation, 
suction system type, 
antiseptic use, and common infection indicators
(fever, leukocytosis, radiographic infiltrates) 
— the tool computes a risk score and classifies 
patients into “Low,” “Moderate,” or “High” risk 
categories.The output includes a clear summary 
of risk-level assessments and actionable care 
recommendations
(e.g., monitoring frequency, preventive measures), 
making it useful for clinicians, 
infection-prevention teams, quality-improvement
initiatives, and retrospective VAE surveillance.
